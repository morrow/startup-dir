Then we saw our friends - teachers and grad students - losing their jobs in the recession. What did they do? They went looking for tutoring gigs by sticking flyers up on telephone poles. \"That's crazy! It hasn't changed!\" we thought, and we set out to fix the problems parents have finding great private tutors, and the problems great tutors have finding good clients. And that's how we ended up here. Let us know what you think, we love feedback."
